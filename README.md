A version of the dictionary lookup I made for the Total English book series.

This tool allows you to input a full sentence to check if the words are in the book.

Now, the functionality is limited, but it works as a minimum viable product.

Future functionality will include:
* a fuzzy word search with recommendations in case you make a typo.
* the ability to click on a word in the fuzzy search that replaces it in the input field automatically.
* the ability to save, during your session, the sentences you input and their results.
